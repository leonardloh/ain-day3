    "n Streamlit, **Session State** is a feature that allows you to store and manage variables across multiple interactions and reruns within a user's session. This capability is essential for creating interactive applications that require data persistence, such as maintaining user inputs, tracking progress, or storing intermediate computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects of Session State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence Across Reruns:** Streamlit scripts rerun from top to bottom upon each user interaction. Without Session State, variables would reset on every rerun. Session State enables variables to retain their values across these reruns, ensuring continuity in user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Specific Data:** Each user's session has its own Session State, meaning data stored here is isolated per user. This isolation is crucial for applications where multiple users interact simultaneously, as it prevents data overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Session State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Session State operates similarly to a Python dictionary, allowing you to store, retrieve, and update values using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using a variable in Session State, check if it exists; if not, initialize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "if 'count' not in st.session_state:\n",
    "    st.session_state['count'] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify a value in Session State:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "st.session_state.count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve and use the stored value as needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "st.write(f\"Current count: {st.session_state.count}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example â€“ Counter Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating a counter that increments each time a button is pressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "st.title('Counter Example')\n",
    "\n",
    "if 'count' not in st.session_state:\n",
    "    st.session_state.count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if st.button('Increment'):\n",
    "    st.session_state.count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "st.write(f\"Count = {st.session_state.count}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `count` variable persists across reruns, allowing the counter to increment correctly with each button press.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Associating Widgets with Session State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can link widget values directly to Session State by assigning a `key` parameter to the widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "st.text_input('Enter your name:', key='username')\n",
    "\n",
    "st.write(f\"Hello, {st.session_state.username}!\")\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the input from the text box is stored in `st.session_state.username`, making it accessible throughout the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callbacks and Session State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit supports callbacks that trigger functions upon widget interaction, allowing for dynamic updates to Session State:\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "```Python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "def update_text():\n",
    "    st.session_state.text = st.session_state.input_text\n",
    "\n",
    "st.text_input('Enter text:', key='input_text', on_change=update_text)\n",
    "\n",
    "st.write(f\"Updated text: {st.session_state.get('text', '')}\")\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `update_text` function updates `st.session_state.text` whenever the text input changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session Duration:** Session State exists as long as the user's browser tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server. Closing the tab or refreshing the page resets the Session State.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Persistence:** Session State is not persisted beyond the session. If the Streamlit server restarts or crashes, all data in Session State is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information and advanced usage, refer to Streamlit's official documentation on [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.session_state).\n",
